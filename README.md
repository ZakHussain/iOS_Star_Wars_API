# iOS_Star_Wars_API_Project

### (1) Hope

	This is a folder that contains the first make of the Star Wars Encyclopedia. It contains a file
call StarWarsModel.swift. This file contains the protocol for retrieving Star Wars character names
and films from http://swapi.co/api/. 

### (2) Star Wars Encyclopedia

	This is a variation of the app contained in the “Hope” folder. It contains another protocol in
  the file titled “PersonModel.” This contains a class named person that should allow us to create
  Person objects for each of the Star Wars characters from the api. The information is being stored, 
  but it is not being displayed from the app. (Since I no longer have an Apple OS that can run Xcode,
  this won’t be fixed for a while). 

### (3) Star Wars Encyclopedia 2

	Ignore this file … 

### (4) Star Wars Encyclopedia 3

	This app incorporates the usage of Core Data in the AppDelegate.swift file. It also pulls the names
  of star wars characters from http://swapi.co/api/people/. Essentially, it’s the previous apps, this
  one just can save the information. This idea of saving the information from the API is useful, in that
  if you have the data yourself, your app will run faster. The downside is that if you are saving the info 
  from the API, you are using up precious memory. So save info wisely.
